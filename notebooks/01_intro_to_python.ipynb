    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will be learning the basics of the Python programming\n",
    "language to accomplish simple tasks. We can use programming to solve\n",
    "complex problems. Once we've written a program we can make it operate on\n",
    "different inputs. This allows us to take one solution and apply to many\n",
    "cases. Before we can solve complex problems we need to break it down in to\n",
    "smaller simpler problems or tasks. Once we've written code to solve each\n",
    "simple task, we can put everything together and solve our complex problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will start with the basics of Python to give you an idea of\n",
    "what functionality Python can provide. By using and combining these techniques\n",
    "we can apply Python programming to our own real world problems to make the\n",
    "computer solve our problems quickly and repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is stored in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file). Notebooks are a\n",
    "special type of file that bring text (like this) and code in to the same file.\n",
    "When Notebooks are used in tools like JupyterLab we can see the code, execute\n",
    "it, and see the results. Results can be simple text or with the right tools\n",
    "we can make images or interactive widgets. By default, a saved Notebook will\n",
    "include all of the text, code, and code results. This allows us to easily\n",
    "explore or analyze a programming problem and then share it with others.\n",
    "Notebooks can be exported as a PDF, an HTML web page, or even a slide show\n",
    "like PowerPoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLab gives us an integrated environment to work with Notebooks and other\n",
    "files all in one browser window. On the top of the window we have the menu bar\n",
    "with typical File, Edit, and View menus, but also special Notebook-specific\n",
    "menus like Kernel. On the left we have the file browser where we\n",
    "can double-click files or folders to open them. When a file is opened it\n",
    "appears in the tabbed area to right. If the file is a simple text format it is\n",
    "usually shown in an editor where you can change the contents of the file and\n",
    "save it for later use. If a notebook file is opened it is presented in an\n",
    "interactive viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are made up of cells. There are two main types of cells: Code and\n",
    "Markdown. Markdown cells hold text, like this one, that is formatted\n",
    "with special characters to represent section headers, or bold words, or other\n",
    "special styling. Code cells hold code to be executed. In this notebook every\n",
    "code cell contains Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells can be executed by selecting them (clicking on them) and hitting\n",
    "`Shift` + `Enter` on the keyboard. This will execute the current cell and\n",
    "select the next cell. Using `Ctrl` + `Enter` will execute the current cell\n",
    "and keep it selected. When a code cell is executing it will show `*` in the\n",
    "brackets to the upper-left of the cell. Code cells will execute in the order\n",
    "you run them and do not run in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main modes in Jupyter Notebooks when working with cells: Edit\n",
    "mode and Command mode. In Edit mode you can change the contents of a cell by\n",
    "typing in the cell. You can enter Edit mode by clicking inside a code cell or\n",
    "hitting \"Enter\" while in Command mode. There will be a green border around a\n",
    "cell when in Edit mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Command mode you can perform operations on the cell like deleting the cell,\n",
    "creating a new cell above or below the current cell, etc. In Command mode\n",
    "cells will have a blue border. You can enter Command mode from Edit mode by\n",
    "hitting \"Esc\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "In command mode you can use various keyboard shortcuts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a: Create new cell above current cell\n",
    "* b: Create new cell below current cell\n",
    "* dd: Delete current cell\n",
