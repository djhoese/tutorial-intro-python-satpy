    "# Introduction to Satpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Satpy is another third-party Python library that provides additional functionality for specifically working with satellite instrument data. Satpy tries to ease the common tasks that people have to perform when working with satellite data. This lesson will provide an introduction to Satpy for reading satellite imagery data from the GOES-16 ABI instrument, creating color RGB images, and plotting data using matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is a shortened version of the lessons available in the Pytroll Satpy Half-day tutorial. For more details on Satpy or a more thorough explanation of the topics discussed in this lesson, view that tutorial [here](https://github.com/pytroll/tutorial-satpy-half-day).\n",

    "# What are we working with?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with earth-observing meteorological satellite instrument\n",
    "data. There are many different variations of how the data can be structured,\n",
    "what it physically represents, how it changes over time, and how it can be used\n",
    "in a particular type of application. The following is an overview of some common\n",
    "characteristics of meteorological satellite observations. We'll go in to a few\n",
    "details as we explore real data later on and completely ignore other\n",
    "details for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Earth-observing\n",
    "\n",
    "Satpy operates on data from earth-observing satellite instruments. The data\n",

    "pollution, and many others.\n",

    "## Geostationary versus Polar-orbiting\n",

    "Satellites can be in a high-altitude geostationary orbit or a lower altitude\n",

    "at higher temporal rates of the same region faster (~30s in some), but usually\n",

    "Polar orbiters are usually at a higher spatial resolution and cover\n",

    "difficult to describe are typically simplified by specifying\n",

    "The satellite instrument data we will be working with are a collection\n",
    "of radiation measurements. By taking individual measurements of\n",
    "the radiation reflected or emitted by objects on Earth, we can get a good\n",
    "snapshot of the Earth from space. Satellite instruments will typically\n",
    "have multiple bands or channels where each one measures a specific wavelength\n",

    "## Sectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Some geostationary satellites record data for different sectors or regions\n",
    "of the Earth depending on their purpose and design. For example the GOES-16\n",
    "ABI instrument has 4 sectors:\n",

While this is very useful, flexible, and requires a very limited amount of processing to visualize, it does require that the viewer know what to expect from each band or wavelength.

The `Scene` knows that we need to resample before we can be able to generate this composite. Let's do that now by using the `native` resampler. We'll also use the `min_area` method to aggregate the data to the lowest resolution in the Scene; 2km in this case (from the `airmass` dependencies):"

    "Looking at satellite instrument data in a Notebook is nice, but it is difficult for Notebook widgets to provide scientists with everything they need for analyzing a dataset. There are many applications that exist for viewing images on a map that provide a suite of tools for analyzing and manipulating the data. One way to get data (images) in to these applications is by providing it in a special image format called GeoTIFF. Luckily, Satpy makes it very easy to save any Scene to a series of GeoTIFFs by using the `save_datasets` method. Let's recreate out `Scene` object and call this method."
